Aloha, this is Lana Wong!  I hope I can do well in this class CS490R.

For my final prject, I'm planning to make the project to share the special skills.  
The three entities will be user, skills, and mark (like favorite): 
User means the users who use this service,
Skills are the skills that users share by uploading,
and Mark is the other users' special skills that the user liked it and mark it.
