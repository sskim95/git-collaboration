Aloha! My name is Sungsoo Kim and I'm from South Korea.

For my final project, I want to build a group study application, which was my project for CIS 305 and CIS 405.
In the application, there will be three entities: user, event, and subject, but it may be slightly modified later.
User is literally means the user of my application.
Event is the place and time where people are going to study together.
Subject is what they are going to study with.
